The [`MultiHandler`](/pkg/log/slog#MultiHandler) function returns a handler that
invokes all the given Handlers.
Its `Enable` method reports whether any of the handlers' `Enabled` methods
return true.
Its `Handle`, `WithAttr` and `WithGroup` methods call the corresponding method
on each of the enabled handlers.
